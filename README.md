## Simple Robotic Arm â€“ First Prototype

This is my first attempt at building a robotic arm using Tinkercad.  
The design focuses on simple joint movement and serves as a starting point for future improvements.

## Tinkercad Link:
You can view or remix the project directly on Tinkercad:

## Possible Uses
- Educational tool for learning basic robotic arm design.
- Base model for practicing servo motor integration and motion logic.
- Starting point for 3D printing and customizing mechanical arms.
- You can build on this prototype and add servos, joints, or electronics later.

## Notes
- This is an early version meant for educational and experimental use.
- Feedback and suggestions are welcome.
- More versions may be published in the future.
