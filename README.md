# Simple-Robotic-Arm
This is my first prototype of a simple robotic arm, created using Tinkercad.  The arm is designed for learning purposes and for testing movement with servo motors.   The STL file is included for 3D printing or further customization.  More updates and improvements may be added in future versions.
